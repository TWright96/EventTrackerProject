# EventTrackerProject

# Overview
 Event tracker will be used to track users impulse buys. ImpulseBuys is a full crud application that is not yet a full stack application. Crud operations were tested using Postman. 

# Technologies Used

* Postman
* JPA
* OOP
* REST
* Java

# Lessons Learned
I learned that we use "Optional" to check our object for null values before crud operations that we cant perform on a null value such as deleting an object with an ID that doesnt exist. I also learned that "@RequestBody" is used to signify the parameter that is being used to save information to the body of the web request. I became more familiar with using Postman during this project and testing my controller methods.
